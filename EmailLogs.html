</h4><br>Correct Answer:<br><ul>
	<li><strong>Group by clause</strong> tells oracle to group rows based on distinct values that exists for specified columns. The group by clause creates a data set , containing several sets of records grouped together based on condition.</li>
	<li><strong>Having clause</strong> can be used with GROUP BY clause. Having imposes a condition on the group by clause which further filters the group created by the GROUP BY clause.</li>

</h4><br>Correct Answer:<br><ul>
	<li><strong>Cross Join:</strong> Cross Join clause produces the cross-product of two tables. This is same as a Cartesian product between the two tables.</li>
	<li><strong>Natural Joins:</strong> Is used to join two tables automatically based on the columns which have matching data types and names, using the keyword NATURAL JOIN. It is equal to the Equi-Join. If the columns have the same names but different data types, than the Natural Join syntax causes an error. Join with the USING clause: If several columns have the same names but the data types do not match, than the NATURAL JOIN clause can be modified with the USING clause to specify the columns that should be used for an equi Join. Use the USING clause to match only one column when more than one column matches. Do not use a table name or alias in the referenced columns. The NATURAL JOIN clause and USING clause are mutually exclusive. For ex: Select a.city, b.dept_name from loc a Join dept b USING (loc_id) where loc_id=10; Joins with the ON clause: Use the ON clause to specify a join condition. The ON clause makes code easy to understand. ON clause is equals to Self Joins. The ON clause can also be used to join columns that have different names</li>
	<li><strong>Left/ Right/ Full Outer Joins:</strong> Left Outer Join displays all rows from the table that is Left to the LEFT OUTER JOIN clause, right outer join displays all rows from the table that is right to the RIGHT OUTER JOIN clause, and full outer join displays all rows from both the tables either left or right to the FULL OUTER JOIN clause</li>

It is equal to the Equi-Join. If the columns have the same names but different data types, than the Natural Join syntax causes an error. Join with the SING clause: If several columns have the same names but the data types do not match, than the NATURAL JOIN clause can be modified with the USING clause to specify the columns that should be used for an equi Join. Use the USING clause to match only one column when more than one column matches. Do not use a table name or alias in the referenced columns. The NATURAL JOIN clause and USING clause are mutually exclusive. For ex: Select a.city, b.dept_name from loc a Join dept b USING (loc_id) where loc_id=10; Joins with the OF clause: Does not use the ON clause to specify a join condition. The ON clause makes code easy to understand. ON clause is equals to Self Joins. The ON clause can also be used to join columns that have different names.</li>
	<li><strong>Left/ Right/ Full Outer Joins</strong>: Left Outer Join does not display all rows from the table that is Left to the LEFT OUTER JOIN clause, right outer join displays all rows from the table that is right to the RIGHT OUTER JOIN clause, and full outer join displays all rows from both the tables either left or right to the FULL OUTER JOIN clause.</li>

</h4><br>Correct Answer:<br><p>General functions are of following types:</p>

<ul>
	<li>NVL: Converts a null value to an actual value. NVL (exp1, exp2) .If exp1 is null then NVL function return value of exp2.</li>
	<li>NVL2: If exp1 is not null, nvl2 returns exp2, if exp1 is null, nvl2 returns exp3. The argument exp1 can have any data type. NVL2 (exp1, exp2, exp3)</li>
	<li>NULLIF: Compares two expressions and returns null if they are equal or the first expression if they are not equal. NULLIF (exp1, exp2)</li>
	<li>COALESCE: Returns the first non-null expression in the expression list. COALESCE (exp1, exp2, expn). The advantage of the COALESCE function over NVL function is that the COALESCE function can take multiple alternative values.</li>
	<li>Conditional Expressions: Provide the use of IF-THEN-ELSE logic within a SQL statement. Example: CASE Expression and DECODE Function.</li>

<p>Types of Cursor:</p>

<p><strong>Implicit Cursor:</strong> If the Oracle engine opened a cursor for its internal processing then it is know as implicit cursor. It is invoked implicitly.</p>

<p><strong>Explicit Cursor:</strong> A cursor which is opened for processing data through a PL/SQL block is know as Explicit Cursor.</p>
